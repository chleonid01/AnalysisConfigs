# MC Truth corrections for PNet pT regression

Repository to compute MC Truth corrections for PNet regressed pT jets, structured as an analysis configurations for a specific development branch from a fork [PocketCoffea](https://github.com/PocketCoffea/PocketCoffea/tree/main).

## Setup

### lxplus
To setup a local installation on `lxplus`:
```bash
# Clone the fork and checkout the desired branch
git clone --branch met-rescaling-jec https://github.com/matteomalucchi/PocketCoffea.git
cd PocketCoffea

#Enter the Singularity image
apptainer shell --bind /afs -B /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch \
         --bind /tmp  --bind /eos/cms/ -B /etc/sysconfig/ngbauth-submit \
         -B ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}  --env KRB5CCNAME="FILE:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/krb5cc"  \
         /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/gitlab-registry.cern.ch/cms-analysis/general/pocketcoffea:lxplus-el9-stable


# Create a local virtual environment using the packages defined in the apptainer image
python -m venv --system-site-packages pocket_coffea_env

# Activate the environment
source pocket_coffea_env/bin/activate

# Install in EDITABLE mode
pip install -e .[dev]
```

After that you should set an alias to activate the PocketCoffea environment because this is called automatically by the `exec.py` script. 

On `lxplus`, it can be done by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias pocket_coffea='apptainer shell --bind /afs -B /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch \
         --bind /tmp  --bind /eos/cms/ -B /etc/sysconfig/ngbauth-submit \
         -B ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}  --env KRB5CCNAME="FILE:${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/krb5cc"  \
         /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/gitlab-registry.cern.ch/cms-analysis/general/pocketcoffea:lxplus-el9-stable'
```

### Other systems

If instead you are using a different system, where for example you want to install the environment in micromamba, you can do the following:

```bash
curl -Ls https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest | tar -xvj bin/micromamba
./bin/micromamba shell init -s bash -p /work/$USER/micromamba # or  ./bin/micromamba shell init -s bash -r ~/micromamba
source ~/.bashrc
micromamba create -n pocket-coffea python=3.11 -c conda-forge
micromamba activate pocket-coffea
pip install coffea==0.7.20

# Clone the fork and checkout the desired branch
git clone --branch met-rescaling-jec https://github.com/matteomalucchi/PocketCoffea.git
cd PocketCoffea
# For developers
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```
After that you should set an alias to activate the PocketCoffea environment because this is called automatically by the `exec.py` script.
On your system, it can be done by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias pocket_coffea='micromamba activate pocket-coffea'
```

## Activate the environment
### lxplus
To activate the environment, you can use the alias defined above:

```bash
source PocketCoffea/pocket_coffea_env/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/PocketCoffea:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Other systems
To activate the environment, you can use the alias defined above:

```bash
pocket_coffea
```


## Workflow
### Running the analysis
To run this over the full dataset for a particular year in each $\eta$ and $p_T$ bin, you can use the following command:

```bash
python exec.py --full -pnet --dir <dir_name> -y <year> [--lxplus]
```

Where `<dir_name>` is the name of the directory where you want to save the results, and `<year>` is the year you want to run the analysis for. The `--lxplus` flag is used to indicate that you are running this on `lxplus` and it will use the `pocket_coffea_env` environment.

Year can be set to:

- 2022_preEE
- 2022_postEE
- 2023_preBPix
- 2023_postBPix

This will save the results in the `dir_name` directory inside the
`output_all.coffea` file. If running on `lxplus`, there will be an output file for each worker in the `dir_name` directory and you can merge them using:
```bash
cd <dir_name>
pocket-coffea merge-outputs -o output_all.coffea output_job_*.coffea
```

The output file contains 2D histograms for each $\eta$ bin in which the x-axis is the jet $p_T$ response and the y-axis is the jet $p_T$.


### Computing the MC Truth corrections
After running the full dataset, in order to compute the MC Truth corrections, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd response_plot/
python response.py --full -d <dir_name> --histo 
```

To run on SLURM on tier3:

```bash
cd response_plot/
sbatch -p short --account=t3 --time=00:10:00 --mem 15gb --cpus-per-task=32 --wrap="python response.py --full -d  <dir_name> --histo -n 32"
```

This will:

- Compute the median of the response in each bin in $\eta$ as a function of $p_T$.
- Get the inverse of the median.
- Fit the inverse of the median with a 6th order polynomial.
- Save the results in the configuration file.

It will also:

- Plot the histograms of the response in each bin in $\eta$ and $p_T$ bin.
- Plot the median of the response in each bin in $\eta$ as a function of $p_T$.
- Plot the inverse of the median in each bin in $\eta$ as a function of $p_T$.
- Plot the resolution of the response in each bin in $\eta$ as a function of $p_T$ using 3 different definitions.

To plot all eta bins on the same plot you can use the following command:

```bash
cd response_plot/
python plot_summary_reponse.py -d <dir_name>
```
This can be used to plot the closure test of the MC Truth corrections.
